The Harpers Ferry raid by John Brown is an important historical event in the context of the CIvil War.
Brown's effort to take control of the federal arsenal and start a rebellion highlighted the resentment
toward slavery that started the Civil War. The increasing moral divide between Southern pro-slavery
defenders and Northern abolitionists was made more clear by Brown's raid. His attack brought the
country closer to war and heightened public conversation about slavery. Although John Brown's rebellion
failed, he still impacted the Civil War the way he wanted to, causing tensions between the North and
South to build.
